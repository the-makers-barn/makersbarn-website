    title: 'About Us',
    intro: `The MakersBarn started as a hub for Makers of different kinds, wood workers, corporate professionals, artists, and dreamers. Somewhere along the way, we realized that what people needed most wasn't just a workshop. It was a place to slow down. So that's what we became.`,
    secondary: `We believe everyone has a Maker in us. Humans are Makers in the heart. Whether that's crafting something with our hands, making peace, or making memories. A gathering, transformative work, sharing and connecting are all core aspects of Makers.`,
    tertiary: `The three of us came together with a vision and a way to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. A stunning 1920s farm, our love for the land, and a dedication to crafting unique lodges have created a place where plants, animals, and people all find happiness.`,
    fourth: `If you're looking to host your next retreat, join one, or simply enjoy a peaceful stay, MakersBarn is ready for you.`,
